# UtilBot
A general purpose utility bot composed of random (and potentially useless) commands

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute a command or function - please open an issue for discussion first. I'm quite particular about this bot's commands and may recommend that you maintain your own fork.

## Self hosting
Download a recent version of cargo via rustup - execute `cargo build --release`. Check `.env.example` for bot configuration.
